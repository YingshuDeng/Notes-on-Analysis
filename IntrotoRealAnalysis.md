# What is Analysis

The difference between analysis and algebra: In algebra, we prove equalities directly; we prove that an object, a number perhaps, is equal to another object. In analysis,
we usually prove inequalities, and we prove those inequalities by estimating.

Suppose next we really wish to prove the equality $x = 0$. In analysis, we prove two inequalities $x\geq 0$ and $x\leq 0$.

To prove $x\leq 0$, we need to prove $x< \sigma$ for all  $\sigma >0$. 

To prove $x\geq 0$, we need to prove $x>- \sigma$ for all  $\sigma >0$

# Basic set theory,
set theory: A set is collection of objects called elements and numbers,
The definition of subset, equal and proper subset,

The set building notation:

${x \in A:P(x)}$,

This notation refers to a subset of the set $A$ containing all elements of A that satisfy the property $P(x)$,

## DeMorgan Theory,

However, switching the order of unions and intersections is not generally permitted without proof. 

## Induction: Principle of induction
## Principle of strong induction

# Functions

## The Cartesian Products and Cartesian plane,
The definition of domain, range and codomain,

Definition of injective or one-to-one function. The definition of surjective or onto. If f is both an surjective and injective, then we say f is bijective or that f is a bijection.

# The composition of the function
# Relations and equivalence classes
If a relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then it is said to be an equivalence relation.

## Cardinality

## d Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.

## The power set of A, 
The power set of A is all subsets of A,

## The definition of an ordered set, 
The definition of bounded above, bounded below, supremum and infimum.

## Definition of a field,
We also require our real numbers to have many algebraic properties. In particular, we require that they are a field. 

What is a ordered field?

## Complex number
Complex number is denoted by $C$, 

and $x+iy$, where x and y are real numbers, and i is the imaginary number, a number such that $i^2 = −1$.

## The set of real numbers

We mentioned already that R contains elements that are not in Q because of the least-upperbound property.

Irrational Numbers is the R\Q,

## Define infinite-
## Maxima and minima

definition of Maxima and minima,
max and min are generally used to emphasize that the supremum or infimum is in the set itself.

## Absolute value
## triangle inequality:
$|x+y|\geq |x|+|y|$,

## Definition of a bounded function,
Suppose f : D → R is a function. We say f is bounded if there exists a number M such that $|f(x)| ≤ M$ for all $x ∈ D$.

## The definition of interval and size of $R$,
$[a,b] := {x ∈ R : a ≤ x ≤ b}$

## Decimal representation for the reals, 重新看，难！

## Sequences and limits,
Sequences and boundness of sequence,


A sequence ${x_{n}}$ is bounded if there exists a $B ∈ R$ such that:

$|x_{n}| \leq B$ for all N,

a limit of a sequence: the definition of a limit of a sequence. A sequence that converges is said to be convergent. Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges or that it is divergent.

When we write $lim xn = x$ for some real number x, we are saying two things: first, that ${xn}$ is convergent, and second, that the limit is x.

## A convergent sequence has a unique limit，
## A convergent sequence {xn} is bounded，
The converse does not hold. A bounded sequence is not necessarily convergent. For example, with the sequence $(-1)^{n}$,

##  Monotone sequences and converges,

## Tail of a sequence,
The beginning of the sequence may be arbitrary.


## Squeeze lemma 
page 56 to 57
Limits, when they exist, preserve non-strict inequalities.
Moreover, you cannot replace all the nonstrict inequalities with strict inequalities.

## Continuity of algebraic operations,


## Recursively defined sequences,

sequence where the next number in the sequence is computed using a formula from a fixed number of preceding elements in the sequences,

## Newton's method,

## Some convergence tests,

## Limit superior, limit inferior and BW theorem,
