# What is Analysis

The difference between analysis and algebra: In algebra, we prove equalities directly; we prove that an object, a number perhaps, is equal to another object. In analysis,
we usually prove inequalities, and we prove those inequalities by estimating.

Suppose next we really wish to prove the equality $x = 0$. In analysis, we prove two inequalities $x\geq 0$ and $x\leq 0$.

To prove $x\leq 0$, we need to prove $x< \sigma$ for all  $\sigma >0$. 

To prove $x\geq 0$, we need to prove $x>- \sigma$ for all  $\sigma >0$

# Basic set theory,
set theory: A set is collection of objects called elements and numbers,
The definition of subset, equal and proper subset,

The set building notation:

${x \in A:P(x)}$,

This notation refers to a subset of the set $A$ containing all elements of A that satisfy the property $P(x)$,

## DeMorgan Theory,

However, switching the order of unions and intersections is not generally permitted without proof. 

## Induction: Principle of induction
## Principle of strong induction

# Functions

## The Cartesian Products and Cartesian plane,
The definition of domain, range and codomain,

Definition of injective or one-to-one function. The definition of surjective or onto. If f is both an surjective and injective, then we say f is bijective or that f is a bijection.

# The composition of the function
# Relations and equivalence classes
If a relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then it is said to be an equivalence relation.

## Cardinality

## d Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.

## The power set of A, 
The power set of A is all subsets of A,

# The definition of an ordered set, 
The definition of bounded above, bounded below, supremum and infimum.










Complex number $C$,

Let F be an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property. Let A ⊂ F be a nonempty set that is bounded below. Then inf A exists.

The set of real numbers,

Archimedean property and Q is dense in R,

Using supremum and infimum，
